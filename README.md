### Firewalld Configuration for `wp-wizard`

**1. Install and Enable `firewalld` if not installed by default:**

```bash
sudo yum install firewalld
sudo systemctl enable firewalld
sudo systemctl start firewalld
```

**2. Enable necessary services and ports:**

a. **HTTP and HTTPS:**
Allowing HTTP and HTTPS is essential for web access and Let's Encrypt Certificate Setup:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
```

b. **MySQL: (Optional)**
If you're planning to allow remote access to MySQL, then you'd want to allow the MySQL port (Usually, it's better to keep this closed and only open it temporarily when necessary):

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mysql
```

**3. Reload `firewalld` to apply the changes:**

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

**4. (Optional) Check the active zones and services:**

To verify your configurations:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```

Note: 
This guide assumes a fresh CentOS/RedHat setup, so adjustments might be necessary if other software or configurations already exist on the server. Always be cautious when configuring your firewall. Only open the ports and services you absolutely need to prevent unnecessary exposure to potential security threats. If your server is hosting multiple services, adjust the firewall rules accordingly.
